# 📊 HR Data Analysis Project

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing HR employee data to extract key insights about satisfaction, work environment, and employee attrition.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- **Source Files**: The original dataset was sourced from multiple sheets (e.g., `Original`, `HR_comma_sep`).
- **Standardization**: Unified inconsistent column names (e.g., `satisfaction_level` → `Satisfaction Level`).
- **Missing/Empty Rows**: Removed irrelevant rows and headers scattered across various sheets (e.g., in `hr pro`).
- **Type Casting**: Converted numeric columns to proper formats for accurate analysis.
- **Deduplication**: Ensured no duplicate entries exist across sheets.

## 📈 Data Analysis
- **Employee Satisfaction**: Calculated the average satisfaction level across departments.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Explored how satisfaction, evaluation scores, and working hours relate to employee turnover.
- **Workload Insights**:
  - Analyzed average monthly hours and number of projects per employee.
  - Grouped data by department and salary level for deeper insights.
- **Promotions & Accidents**: Investigated promotion trends and workplace accident rates across different experience levels.

## 📊 Visualization and Pivoting
- Created pivot tables for:
  - Salary distribution across departments.
  - Global average of employee satisfaction.
- Highlighted trends in employee engagement and retention metrics.
