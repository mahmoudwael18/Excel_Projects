In this project, I cleaned and analyzed Adidas sales data to uncover key business insights. Here's a summary of the work:

### ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning:
- Removed irrelevant header rows from the Excel sheet.
- Standardized column names for easier analysis.
- Fixed data types (e.g., converted dates, numerical columns).

### ðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis:
- Analyzed total sales by region, state, and city to find top-performing locations.
- Compared sales performance by product type and sales method (online vs in-store).

- Visualized key KPIs using pivot charts and dashboards.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:
- **Foot Locker** and **Dick's Sporting Goods** are the top-performing retailers.
